Node Structure.

Data Field:
Stores the actual value or data that the node is intended to hold.
It could be any type of data (int, char, float, etc.) based on the type defined when 
creating the node.

Pointer Field:
Stores the memory address of the next node in the linked list.
It's essentially a reference or a link to the subsequent node.

Understanding the Node structure is crucial as it forms the building block of the 
linked list. Each node not only holds a piece of data but also a reference to the 
next node, which allows it to chain them together and create a dynamic, linear data structure.



Insert.

The "insert" function in a linked list adds a new node to the list at a specified position,0
shifting existing nodes as necessary to accommodate the new element. This operation 
typically involves traversing the list to find the correct insertion point and adjusting 
the pointers of the neighboring nodes to include the new node. The inserted node's pointer 
is set to the node that previously occupied the position, and the previous node's pointer 
is updated to point to the new node. This allows for the seamless integration of the new 
node into the existing linked list structure.


Insert at tail/ Insert at index.


The "Insert at tail" function in a linked list adds a new node to the end of the list. 
This involves traversing the list to find the current tail node and then setting the next
pointer of that node to the new node.
 

The "Insert at index" function in a linked list inserts a new node at a specified position 
in the list, shifting subsequent nodes as needed. This typically involves traversing the 
list to find the node at the given index and adjusting pointers to include the new node.

Delete/ Update.

The "delete" function in a linked list removes a node from the list by adjusting the pointers
of the surrounding nodes to bypass the node being deleted. 
This operation typically involves finding the node to be deleted by traversing the 
list and then updating the pointers of the previous and next nodes to skip over the node 
being removed.


The "update" function in a linked list modifies the value of a node at a specified 
position by traversing to that node and changing its data field. 
This operation alters the content of an existing node without changing the overall 
structure or arrangement of the linked list.

Get Node.

The "get" function in a linked list retrieves the value of a node at a specified position 
by traversing to that node in the list. This operation allows you to access and return the 
data stored in a particular node without modifying the structure of the linked list.

The Results.


A linked list is a dynamic data structure commonly used in computer science and programming.
Each element in a linked list is represented as a node, which contains both data and a 
pointer to the next node in the sequence.
This structure supports various operations through functions such as insert, insert at tail,
insert at index, delete, update, and get, allowing for flexible and efficient data 
manipulation.
These functions enable developers to add, remove, modify, and access elements within the 
linked list based on specific requirements and positions.
